At its core, the platform allows anyone to mint customizable NFT art and make it available to collectors in a frictionless, gasless environment. By harnessing the transparency and trust of blockchain along with layer 2 scaling solutions, we remove barriers while maintaining integrity. Creators can directly mint generative pieces that are randomly assembled from composable layers designed within our intuitive canvas app. The output is a unique NFT that represents complete ownership and attribution to the artist. Listing on our built-in marketplace then allows setting dynamic pricing, timed auctions, royalty shares, and accepting a range of cryptocurrencies from interested buyers. There are no middlemen or fees extracted - creators retain the full share of proceeds. Activity feeds provide creators with insights into bid histories, active listings, and other analytics to inform pricing strategies and spawn new creative directions. The full history and ownership is transparently tracked on-chain. Ultimately, we want to empower the creators themselves by combining the best of blockchain decentralization with tools that maximize flexibility in monetizing original generative artwork.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-gennft-docs","text":"","title":"Welcome to GenNFT Docs"},{"location":"#gennft-docs","text":"# **The intent** # -- Our NFT marketplace empowers content creators by giving them full control and flexibility over monetizing their generative artwork in a decentralized setting.
